# Dublin Transport Quiz

A quiz designed to test your knowledge of Dublin's three key public transport services. The Dart, the Bus and the Luas.

## Project Kickoff

My idea for the Portfolio 2 project was to code a quiz using 8bit graphics as I felt my knowledge of javascript is quite basic so it makes sense for the style of the site to hark back to more basic time of the internet. I chose the 3 main Dublin Transport services as the focus of my quiz as I thought they would make cool graphics and I only very recently got a car so I spent nearly three decades using the beloved Dart, Bus and Luas. 

## Design

One of my key learnings from the first portfolio project was the practicality of designing mobile first so I began with the homepage, main quiz page,and about page, a game over page and a quiz completed page.

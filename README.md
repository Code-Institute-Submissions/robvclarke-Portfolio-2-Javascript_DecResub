A quiz designed to test your knowledge of Dublin's three key public transport services. The Dart, the Bus and the Luas.

## Project-Kickoff 

My idea for the Portfolio 2 project was to code a quiz using 8bit graphics as I felt my knowledge of javascript is quite basic so it makes sense for the style of the site to hark back to more basic time of the internet. I chose the 3 main Dublin Transport services as the focus of my quiz as I thought they would make cool graphics and I only very recently got a car so I spent nearly three decades using the beloved Dart, Bus and Luas. 

The goal of the project was to create a simple visually impressive quiz that would test users knowledge of Dublin cities three main types of public transport with interesting questions, impressive visuals and an enjoyable user experience.



## Visual Design

### Graphics

I designed all the graphics in Adobe Illustrator. I used the grid and live paint tools to create the 8bit style retro graphics. The main points of inspiration were the three castles burning on the Dublin crest worn by the GAA team. I also took inspiration from the original video game 'DOOM' for the PC for the game over screen. In the DOOM game as your health decreased your face became more bloody so I created an illustration of the president of Ireland Michael D Higgins looking a bit worse for wear when you get a game over and one of him wearing shades enjoying a smoke when you complete it. I used the three castles again to represent your three lives, with you losing a castle for each incorrect answer. 
The various forms of transport themselves make up the rest of the illustrations along with a simple 8bit dublin city skyline.

### Color Pallette

The color pallette took inspiration from the Dublin flag with its tones of blue for the colder side of it. The flames that appear on the three burning castles of the city's emblem were the inspiration for the warmer side.

### Typography

For the typography I used the font '8 Bit Wonder' from [Link to DaFont](https://www.dafont.com/8bit-wonder.font) its not a web font so wherever I used it I had to export SVGs from Figma and have them as images in the site. I felt a 8bit font such as this was key to the vibe of the site I wanted to get across so I feel it was worth the extra work.
The other font I used was 'Roboto Mono' as it is a monospaced font common in this kind of style as it's a google font so very easy to use [Link to Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono)

## UX

### Wireframes

I designed the screens in Figma. One of my key learnings from the first portfolio project was the practicality of designing mobile first in particular when you are going to be the one developing the site so I began with the homepage, main quiz page,and about page, a game over page and a quiz completed page.

I then designed the desktop screens afterwards which was far easier than doing it vice versa as you have more space to play with rather than less.

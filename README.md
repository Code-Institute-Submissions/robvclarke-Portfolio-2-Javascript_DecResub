# Dublin Transport Quiz

A quiz designed to test your knowledge of Dublin's three key public transport services. The Dart, the Bus and the Luas.

## Project Kickoff

My idea for the Portfolio 2 project was to code a quiz using 8bit graphics as I felt my knowledge of javascript is quite basic so it makes sense for the style of the site to hark back to more basic time of the internet. I chose the 3 main Dublin Transport services as the focus of my quiz as I thought they would make cool graphics and I only very recently got a car so I spent nearly three decades using the beloved Dart, Bus and Luas. 

## Design

I designed all the graphics in Adobe Illustrator. I used the grid and live paint tools to create the 8bit style retro graphics. The main points of inspiration were the three castles burning on the Dublin crest worn by the GAA team. I also took inspiration from the original video game 'DOOM' for the PC for the game over screen. In the DOOM game as your health decreased your face became more bloody so I created an illustration of the president of Ireland Michael D Higgins looking a bit worse for wear when you get a game over and one of him wearing shades enjoying a smoke when you complete it. I used the three castles again to represent your three lives, with you losing a castle for each incorrect answer. 
The various forms of transport themselves make up the rest of the illustrations along with a simple 8bit dublin city skyline.

One of my key learnings from the first portfolio project was the practicality of designing mobile first so I began with the homepage, main quiz page,and about page, a game over page and a quiz completed page.

I then designed the desktop screens afterwards which was far easier than doing it vice versa as you have more space to play with rather than less.
